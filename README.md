# Calculator
A Calculator using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT
#  Calculator Web App
Welcome to my **Basic Calculator** project!  
This is a simple yet functional calculator built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project helped me solidify my understanding of how JavaScript interacts with the DOM, how to handle events, and how to create a clean user interface using HTML and CSS.


##  Project Overview

The calculator is designed to mimic the functionality of a basic physical calculator. It includes:
- A clean and responsive user interface.
- Buttons for digits (0-9), operations (+, −, ×, ÷), decimal, clear (C), and equals (=).
- Functionality to handle chained operations (e.g., 2 + 3 × 4).
- Real-time display of input and result.
- Input validation and error handling (e.g., preventing division by zero or multiple decimals).

##  Purpose of the Project

I created this calculator project as a way to apply my growing skills in:
- Web development using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- Understanding the **Document Object Model (DOM)**
- Practicing **event handling and logic building**
- Designing a user-friendly, interactive interface

It was also an opportunity to build something practical and familiar while practicing clean code structure and project organization.

##  Technologies Used

###  HTML
- Structured the layout of the calculator including the display and buttons.
- Created semantic sections for the screen and keypad.

###  CSS
- Styled the calculator layout, button design, and responsive spacing.
- Used flexbox/grid to align buttons properly.
- Designed for both desktop and mobile-friendly experiences.

###  JavaScript
- Handled logic for all calculator functions.

##  How It Works
1. When the user clicks a number, it gets added to the display.
2. Clicking an operator stores the current number and the operation.
3. Clicking "=" performs the calculation and displays the result.
4. "C" clears all input and resets the calculator.
5. The calculator handles:
   - Continuous operations (like 5 + 2 × 3)
   - Floating-point numbers (decimals)
   - Division by zero (with error handling)


##  What I Learned

Building this calculator helped me:
- Strengthen my understanding of **DOM manipulation**
- Learn how to structure JavaScript logic in functions
- Handle **event listeners** effectively
- Build user-friendly layouts with **CSS grid/flexbox**
- Think through **input validation and edge cases**
- Improve debugging and browser console testing


##  Project Improvements (Future Scope)

In future versions, I plan to:
- Add keyboard support (use keys as input)
- Improve the design with animations or transitions
- Add advanced functions like square root, exponent, or memory
- Store calculation history
- Convert this into a React-based calculator for deeper frontend experience
